## About:

This is a working example of one page generation using Jekyll.  
The site is about me. Even if you don't care about me, you could find a trick
or two from the source.

## Dependencies:

### Jekyll

Obviously. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)  
And whatever Jekyll is depended on.  
I like to use kramdown since I can apply classes to elements

You have to modify \_config.yml. If you have no idea what you should do, you should check [this doc](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration).

### usage

Documentation is coming.

Until then you can get almost anything by `npm install` on the root.  
If you get error doing it, you need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
